# Portfolio Projects for Data Science

This repository contains my hands-on portfolio projects developed in Python. Each project highlights a core data science skill such as A/B testing, anomaly/outlier detection, fraud detection, simulation, statistical inference, SQL queries, and dashboard development. 

For project-specific details and instructions, please refer to the `README.md` file within each project folder.

**Tools used: Python, SQL (via Python), Streamlit, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and more**
