# Portfolio Projects for Data Science

This repository contains my hands-on portfolio projects developed in both Python and R. Each project highlights a core data science skill such as A/B testing, fraud detection, simulation, statistical inference, and dashboard development. 

For project-specific details and instructions, please refer to the `README.md` file within each project folder.

**Tools used: Python, R, SQL (via Python), Streamlit, Shiny, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, tidyverse, and more**
